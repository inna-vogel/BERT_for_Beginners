Using BERT for the first time

Note: The original code in this notebook is from Jay Alammar: https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/bert/A_Visual_Notebook_to_Using_BERT_for_the_First_Time.ipynb

In this notebook, DistilBERT is used to process sentences from film reviews. The output of DistilBERT is then used to train a Logistic Regression model from scikit learn to calssify the sentences as either being positeve (1) or negative (0).
