# BERT_for_Beginners
Using BERT for the first time

Note: The original code in this notebook is from Jay Alammar: https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/bert/A_Visual_Notebook_to_Using_BERT_for_the_First_Time.ipynb

In this notebook, we will use pre-trained deep learning model to process some text. We will then use the output of that model to classify the text. The text is a list of sentences from film reviews. And we will calssify each sentence as either speaking "positively" about its subject of "negatively".
